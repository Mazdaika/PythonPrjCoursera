#Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
#
#We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.
#
#Sample data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html (Sum=2553)
#Actual data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_252402.html (Sum ends with 67)
#You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

import urllib
import bs4
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

while True:
    url = raw_input("Enter url:")
    try:
        html = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
        break
    except Exception as err:
        print "Enter a valid url!\n" + err.message
# try Soup
beautifulHtml = bs4.BeautifulSoup(html,"html.parser")
spans = beautifulHtml.findAll("span")


sum = 0
for span in spans:
    sum = sum+int(span.get_text())
print sum

# try element tree
parsed = ET.fromstring(html)
spans2 = parsed.findall(".//span")
sum2 = 0
for span in spans2:
    sum2 = sum2+int(span.text)
print sum2
